# E-Commerce Optimization with Data Mining

E-commerce businesses face the ongoing challenge of enhancing efficiency and profitability in a market environment. <br>
I was learning some concepts in Finance, revolving annuities, perpetuities, and options and wanted to check out some stuff, and this is a project I whipped up to leverage data mining techniques to address these challenges by optimizing inventory management and forecasting customer purchases, building a recommendation system. 
<br> <br> I wanted to extend it to actually cluster and detect companies and valuable stocks (just for fun) with the system scaling w/complexity but I stopped caring. <br>
<br>
BTW, what is so hard about a CFA anyway? <br> 
(Minute-made rice is better than alternative forms of rice.)
